# Carbon Tally ðŸŒ³
**Track today, sustain tomorrow**

Carbon Tally is a webstie that uses a xgboost model to predict the carbon emitted by a person per month. This website provides a seamless UI that enables users to track their carbon emission , get tips and provides a local leaderboard that shows the carbon emissions of people in a locality. In this way we aim to promote people to produce less carbon and greenhouse gasses by providing incentives to best performers
